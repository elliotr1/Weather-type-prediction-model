# Weather Prediction Model Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a weather prediction model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the type of weather based on various environmental conditions such as humidity, wind speed, and temperature. The model was developed using Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and analysis.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: Model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: Creating visualizations to understand data patterns.
- **Seaborn**: Enhancing the visual aesthetics of plots.


## Outcome Summary
The model achieved promising results with the following weighted average metrics:
- **Precision**: 0.986765
- **Recall**: 0.967685
- **F1-score**: 0.977105

These metrics indicate effective performance in predicting weather types based on the provided environmental features.
