<h1>Weather-type-prediction-model</h1>
<h3>
  In this project I used the following libraries: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pandas for manipulating data/li>
    <li>Numpy for statistical manipuation</li>
    <li>Sklearn for splitting, training and testing and visualising the data</li>
    <li>Matplotlib for visualing the data</li>
    <li>Seaborn for visualing the data</li>
  </ul>

<p>In this project I built a weather prediction model using Kaggle notebook's to predict what type of weather is expected based on conditions such as Humidity, Wind speed, Temperature etc.</p>


<p>Overall for this project the outcomes were good results. With a weighted average of: <br>
  precision	recall	f1-score <br>
  0.986765	0.967685	0.977105</p>
